Purpose:
- Bumps threads to prevent early closure.
- Can start threads as well.

Features:
- Posts message in thread to keep alive. (Message can be deleted or saved depending on user choice)
- Can schedule/unschedule bumpings to prevent constant use of the !bump command.
- Use of the !create command to create a new thread.
- Possible !delete command as well.

To Consider:
1. Persistence
   - What if the bot does down and a thread is archived during maintenance? Should those threads be unarchived?
2. Concurrency Implementation
   - How do we achieve scheduling of bumping using asyncio?
3. Possible Hangups
   - What if a thread isn't active and a scheduled message is sent out? Should the channel be revived?
